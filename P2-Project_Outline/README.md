# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application is about beer journals and searching for different types of beers. My application should give users an option to make an account and everytime they log into their account they should be able to track different beers they've had and information about that beer such as color, abv levels, and etc. The user should also be able to rate beers whenever they are signed in as well. Besides keeping track of the different beers they've had they can also search for different ones based on color, abv, type, name, and etc. They should be able to search for individual beers as well as restaurants and stores that have specific or unique beers they want to try.

Users might find the journal combined with the search functions useful because they would be able to track information on a beer, their own personal thoughts and ratings as well as being able to search different ones when they can't remember the names. Also they might find the app useful when wanting to try out new beers and not having a clue where to find them, essentially the app is like a blog/journal setup combined with google search all in one. The idea came when I was searching applications for the basic setup of a beer journal and the applications were terrible or didn't work and I thought that I wanted to have at least a working journal. Then the more I thought of it the more I realized that it would be inconvenient if I also had to search up different kinds of beer on a separate application. All of the following seemed troublesome so I figured combining the two ideas/thoughts would be a good idea or at least a more convenient one.
### Features
1. User Login: A user will be able to create an account and log into the application. When they have logged in they will be able to see every page or their beer journal.
2. Search: A user will be able to search for different beers in the search engine based on name and other details of said beer. There will also be search functions for restaurants and stores about what kinds of beers they sell and if they sell any unique ones.
3. Create a Page: A user will be able to create a new page where they are able to track information on beer such as the color and etc. and they would also be able to rate it. These posts will appear on the user's application once they are signed in.
### Technologies
1. Java
2. Spring Boot
3. MySQL
4. Hibernate
5. Thymeleaf templates
6. CSS
7. HTML
8. JavaScript
9. Angular
10. API
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to use data for an API possibly or will have to learn some new elements from JavaScript to make my page interactive. The biggest problem I can see myself running into is how to create the search function to be able to find which restaurants or stores have specific beers. In learning how to implement the search function I see myself running into problems about what technologies I will use and how I will implement them with the other technologies I am using.
